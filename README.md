# React Track Runner

As a long-distance runner trains for the olympics, she wants to track her best run.

You are welcome to fork and clone this repository (don't forget to `npm install`) or start fresh with `create-react-app`.

## Base Requirements

Create an application that allow her to enter her most recent run. It should always update the most recent section, but if it's her longest run, it should also update that section as well.

A deployed version of this application in action can be found at: react-track-runner.netlify.com

## Stretch Goals

As the long-distance runner trains, she realizes that she would also like to know how fast she is going. Add another section for her fastest run that displays the fastest run based on miles per hour.
